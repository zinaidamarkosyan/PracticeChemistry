    question: "In which unit is the rate of a reaction written in?",
    correctAnswer:
    {
      answer: "M/s",
      explanation: `
              The rate (or speed) of reaction is related to the change in concentration \
              (molarity or moles over liter) of either a reactant or product over time \
              (seconds). The rate then represents the speed of consumption of the \
              reactants, which is the same as the speed of formation of the products. \
              The standard units for rate are molarity/seconds (M/s).

        answer: "mol/s",
        explanation: `
              In some cases the rate could be expressed in terms of moles over time \
              (seconds), but it's not usually portrayed this way.

      },
      {
        answer: "g/s",
        explanation: `
              For chemical reactions, there is a conservation of moles rather than mass, \
              so mass as a unit is not so useful in this case.

    question: `
      A zero order reaction (A to B) has a rate of 1 M/s. It starts with a \
      concentration of A of 10 M, and after 5 seconds, there are 5 M of A left, and 5 M \
      more of A are added. How much time in seconds will it take for the 10 M to fully \
      convert into B?
      `,
    correctAnswer:
    {
      answer: "10 seconds",
      explanation: `
              Given the reaction is of zero order, the rate of 1 M/s will always be \
              the same. If the reaction started with 10 M of A, and 5 M of A were \
              consumed after 5 seconds of the reaction, this just means that we can \
              confirm that in fact the rate of the reaction is 1 M/s. With 5 M of A \
              left, and 5 M more of A added, there are 10 M of A now, and it will take \

    question: `
      A zero order reaction (2A to B), has A disappearing at a rate of 1.5 M/s. What \
      is the rate of appearance of B?
      `,
    correctAnswer: {
      answer: "0.75 M/s",
      explanation: `
          The rates of disappearance of reactants and appearance of products can be related \
          to each other based on the stoichiometry of the reaction. \
          Rate = -[ΔA]/2Δt = [ΔB]/Δt, where -[ΔA]/Δt = rate of disappearance of A, and \
          [ΔB]/Δt = rate of appearance of B.

          Replacing the equation then we get that: (1.5 M/s)/2 = rate of appearance of \
          B ➝ 0.75 M/s = rate of appearance of B. In other words, for each 1 M of B \
          that's being produced, there are 2 M of A that are being consumed.

              The rates of disappearance of reactants and appearance of products can be related \

              [ΔB]/Δt = rate of appearance of B.

              So -0.75 M/s is not the correct answer because the rate of appearance is \
              positive. The reason for the rate of disappearance to be positive too, is \
              that the negative sign (-) is already taken into account within the \

              The rates of disappearance of reactants and appearance of products can be related \

              Rate = -[ΔA]/2Δt = [ΔB]/Δt, where -[ΔA]/Δt = rate of disappearance of A, and \
              [ΔB]/Δt = rate of appearance of B.

              Notice the factor (2) in the denominator, that's because for each 2 moles \
              of A that are consumed, 1 mole of B is produced. So 1.5 M/s is not the \
              correct answer because that's the rate of disappearance of A, so in one \
              second 1.5 M of A are consumed, but in that same second, in order for that \
              to happen, only half the amount of B is produced.

              The rates of disappearance of reactants and appearance of products can be related \

              Notice the factor (2) in the denominator and not in the numerator. The \
              rate of a reaction is based on 1 mole or M, so because of the \
              stoichiometry of the reaction, the rate of the reaction will be half of \
              the rate of disappearance of A, so that's why the value 2 is in the \

    correctAnswer: {
      answer: "4[ΔB]/Δt",
      explanation: `
          The rates of disappearance of reactants and appearance of products can be related \
          to each other based on the stoichiometry of the reaction. \
          Rate = -[ΔA]/4Δt] = [ΔB]/Δt = [ΔC]/Δt, where -[ΔA]/Δt = rate of disappearance of \
          A, and [ΔB]/Δt = rate of appearance of B, and [ΔC]/Δt = the rate of appearance \

          Easily enough, if we solve for -[ΔA]/Δt in the equation \

      A zero order reaction (A to B) started 1 minute ago. A currently has a \

      answer: "7 M",
      explanation: `
          Since it's a zero order reaction, we can first determine the rate (or k) by \
          simply: -ΔC/Δt. When there were 5 M of A, it was reduced to 4 M in 30 \

          Since it's a zero order reaction, we can first determine the rate (or k) by \
          simply: -ΔC/Δt. When there were 10 M of A, it was reduced to 8 M in 5 hours. \
          In other words, 2 M of A was consumed in 5 hours. We can replace in the \
          equation:

          Rate = k = -(8M - 10M)/(29 - 24) = 0.4 M/h.

          The equation for a zero order reaction is: [A] = [A_0_] - kt. Now we can use \
          either data point to solve for [A_0_]:

          [A_0_] = [A] + kt ➝
          [A_0_] = 10 + 0.4(24) = 19.6 M

          Knowing that, the equation for half-life of zero order reaction is: \
          t_1/2_ = [A_0_]/2k. Replacing the values: t_1/2_ = 19.6/2(0.4) = 24.5 h.

      answer: "Concentration / time",
      explanation: `
          The rate (or speed) of reaction is related to the change in concentration \
          (molarity) of either a reactant or product over time (seconds). The rate then \
          represents the speed of consumption of the reactants, which is the same as the \
          speed of formation of the products. The standard units for rate are \
          molarity/seconds (M/s).

        answer: "Concentration \\* time",
        explanation: `
              The rate of reaction represents the speed of consumption of \
              reactants in M/s, so concentration \\* time would be M \\* s.

        answer: "Time / concentration",
        explanation: `
              The rate of reaction represents the speed of consumption of \
              reactants in M/s, so time/concentration would be s/M.

        answer: "It varies",
        explanation: `
              The rate constant k units vary, but not the units for the rate \
              which are always M/s or any concentration/time unit.
